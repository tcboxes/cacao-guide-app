## [Unreleased]

### ✨ New Features & Design
- **"Pause, Open, Discover" Flow:** Refactored the entire ceremony structure to follow the 'POD' narrative arc.
    - **Pause (Phase 1):** Grounding and Gratitude (Base of triangle).
    - **Open (Phase 2):** Intention and Savouring (Sides of triangle).
    - **Discover (Phase 3):** Connection and Reflection (Center of triangle).
- **Triangle Visual Identity:** Replaced the linear progress bar with a dynamic `TrianglePhaseIcon` that evolves and builds as the ceremony progresses, inspired by the Tri Hita Karana philosophy.
- **Phase Transitions:** Added gentle transition screens between the three phases to guide the user's journey.

### ♻️ Updates & Improvements
- **App Title:** Updated to "Join Cacao's Guide".
- **Audio Guide Tuning:** 
    - Removed "slow-paced" instruction to make the speech flow more naturally.
    - Added "soft, whispery" instruction to the AI prompt to ensure a more intimate, meditative tone.
- **Intention-Based Ceremony:** The descriptions for the "Savour" and "Connect" steps are dynamically generated by the Gemini API to align with the user's specific intention.
- **Ceremony Actions:** Made prompts more inclusive (e.g., "If you feel comfortable, close your eyes").
- **Localization:** Standardised on UK English spellings (e.g., "Savour", "Personalised").

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Audio Speed:** Fixed an issue where the TTS voice was speaking too slowly, breaking the flow of the ritual.
