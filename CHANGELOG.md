## [Unreleased]

### ✨ Added
- **Intention-Based Ceremony:** The descriptions for the "Savour" and "Connect" steps are now dynamically generated by the Gemini API to align with the user's specific intention. This creates a more personalised and meaningful ritual.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` File:** This file was created to provide a clear and organised history of application updates, making it easier to track progress and review changes.

### ♻️ Changed
- **Made Ceremony Actions More Public-Friendly:** To ensure users feel comfortable performing the ceremony anywhere, two key prompts were updated:
    - "Arrive" step: "Close your eyes" was changed to the more optional "If you feel comfortable, close your eyes..."
    - "Connect" step: "Rest a hand on your heart" was replaced with the more internal and discreet "Gently bring your focus to your breath..."
- **Spelling:** Updated application-wide text to use UK English spellings (e.g., "Savour" instead of "Savor", "personalised" instead of "personalized").
